                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    I began my programming journey in the third grade, trying
                    to learn python on the family computer. Since then, I have
                    played around with many languages but only started my 
                    formal education while stationed in Okinawa, Japan. 
                    I am now attending at Quinnipiac University and will 
                    acquire my BS in 2026!
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
                    Aside from programming, I like to spend my time with family 
                    or playing games with the friends I made while travelling.
                    I read many books but only for fun and I like to 3D print and
                    design my own electronics.
                    </p>
