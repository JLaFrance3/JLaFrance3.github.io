                <a href="https://github.com/PeterZegarek/QuinnipiacMarketplace">Quinnipiac Marketplace</a>
                <p>
                    My most recent project, QuinnipiacMarketplace, was great because I was able to work asynchronously with other students!

                <h2>Drones</h2>
                <a href="https://github.com/JLaFrance3/drones">Drones</a>
                <p>
                    Another recent example is Drones, where we used an external archive to get used to using graphics in Java.

                <h2>Catering Spreadsheet</h2>
                <a href="https://github.com/JLaFrance3/Catering-AppsScript">Catering Spreadsheet</a>
                <p>
                    The most practical programming I have done was in 2017, working as an Area Manager for Subway. 
                    I wanted to make our account balancing spreadsheet easier by making use of Google's App Script.

                <h2>Game</h2>
                <a href="https://github.com/JLaFrance3/LastStand.git">game</a>
                <p>
                    The most fun programming I have done was in 2014 where I made the beginnings of a game in my free time. 
                    My buddy made me some nice sprites!
